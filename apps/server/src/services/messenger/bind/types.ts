 * How the client should present a one-click bind:

 * - `qr`       — show `payload.qrValue` as a QR code to scan with the IM app
 *                (WeChat iLink). There is nothing to open on this device.
 * - `deeplink` — open `payload.url` on a phone (Telegram `t.me/<bot>?start=`,
 *                iMessage `sms:` prefilled with a code). `payload.qrValue`
 *                carries the same URL so a desktop can hand it to a phone.
 * - `oauth`    — open `payload.url` in a browser; the platform's consent
 *                screen finishes the bind (Slack, Discord).
